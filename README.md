# Sudoku Solver

## Starting Grid:
<ul>
  <li>You need a text (.txt) file containing your grid before running the program.</li>
  <li>Enter each number into the text file with spaces between each number.</li>
  <li>Blank spaces in the grid should be entered as zeroes (0).</li>
  <li>Make sure the text file is in the same directory as the application after compiling.</li>
</ul>

## Running the Program:
The terminal will ask for your file name. Do not forget the .txt extension, and press enter to continue.

## The Solution!
The terminal should output the completed grid if it is solvable. If it is not, it will display "No Solution". Check for typos in your .txt file.

## Saving the Solution:
If you would like to save the solution, enter "Y" into the program when prompted. It will save it to a new file called "solution.txt".
